### File directory

- **index.html** and **styles.css** were provided as base code. Untouched save my own comments.
- **design.js** is the money-maker, the four+ hour time sink, but it came out well in the end.

The base code was provided by the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) with some support from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)â€”and the friends we made along the way.

### Developer thoughts 

Truthfully, I was hesitant about this project. I wanted to skip it altogether because I've been struggling with JavaScript for over a decade, and I didn't think that that would change today. However, in lieu of thinking about other things on my mind, I sat down, kept opening and closing the door for my cat, and did the dang thing. And look! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ We did it! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ 

I'm honestly just as surprised, uh. Yeah. It's wild. I'm not sure how I should feel except incredibly surprised. I would like to be able to change the size of the individual cells. I don't think that should be too, too difficult, since I've figured out how to process the height and width. (I say that, and then...)

Anyway, thank you for reading!
